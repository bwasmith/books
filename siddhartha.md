I have spent a long time and have not yet finished, in order to learn this, Govinda: that one can learn nothing. There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning.

Let us enjoy this fruit and await further ones... whether there are still other and better fruits, let us patiently wait and see (23)

Nobody was so alone as he. He was no nobleman, belonging to any aristocracy, no artisan belonging to any guild and finding refuge in it, sharing its life and language. He was no Brahmin, sharing the life of Brahmins, no ascetic belonging to the Samanas. Even the most secluded hermit in the woods was not one and alone; he belonged to a class of people... But he, Siddhartha, where did he belong? Whose life would he share? Whose language would he speak? (41)
