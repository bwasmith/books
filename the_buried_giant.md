## Quotes

That's true, good lady, but then we boatmen have seen so many over the years it
doesn't take us long to see beyond deceptions. Besides, when travellers speak of
their most cherished memories, it's possible for them to disguise the truth. A
couple my claim to be bonded by love, but we boatmen may see instead resentment,
anger, even hatred. Or a great barrenness. Sometimes a fear of loneliness and
nothing more. Abiding love that has endured the years--that we see only rarely
(43)

I won't believe it, sir. How is it possible to hate so deeply for deeds not yet
done? The good people who once took shelter here would have kept alive their
opes to the end, and surely watched all suffering, of friend and foe, with pity
and horror.
You're much the senior in years, Master Axl, but in matters of blood it may be
I'm the elder and you the youth. I've seen dark hatred as bottomless as the sea
on the faces of old women and tender children, and some days felt such hatred
myself (142)

What kind of god is it, sir, wishes wrongs to go forgotten and unpunished? (285)

## Thoughts/Description

Crazy book. So well strung together and fantastic.

Things to think about:
- Beatrice and Axl
- The boatman
- Sir Gawain (his armor, horse, manner of speaking)
- The warrior (his hate)
- The dragon

Things I have no idea about:
- the thematic significance of the boy
- The monks?
