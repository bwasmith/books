## Quotes
I cannot recall any colleague who could paint a self-portrait with absolute
honesty; however accurately one may fill in the surface details of one's mirror
reflection, the personality represented rarely comes near the truth as others
would see it (67)

It may not always be an easy thing, but there is certainly a satisfaction and
dignity to be gained in coming to terms with the mistakes one has made in the
course of one's life. In any case, there is surely no great shame in mistakes
made in the best of faith. It is surely a thing far more shameful to be unable
or unwilling to acknowledge the (125)

I returned her smile, but did not say anything. Of course, the old district had
been fine. We had all enjoyed ourselves and the spirit that had pervaded the
bantering and those arguments had never been less than sincere. But then perhaps
that same spirit had not always been for the best. Like many things now, it is
perhaps as well that that little world has passed away an will not be returning.
I was tempted to say as much to Mrs Kawakami that evening, but decided it would
be tactless to do so. For clearly, the old district was dear to her heart--much
of her life and energy had been invested in it--and one can surely understand
her reluctance to accept it as gone forever (127)

For indeed, a man who aspires to rise above the mediocre, to be something more
than ordinary, surely deserves admiration, even if in the end he fails and
loses a fortune on account of his ambitions (135)

If one has failed only where others have not had the courage or will to try,
there is a consolation--indeed, a deep satisfaction--to be gained from this
observation when looking back over one's life (135)

## Thoughts/Description

The way that Ishiguro shapes his novels is phenomenal. The representation of the
main character as a window into an old world, an old set of ideals, and how this
character confronts new realities in a modern world. Brilliant. Characters which
represent old Japan, the things it tried to be and why. Characters which embody
new Japan, the things it tries to forget and the ways it wishes to be redefined.

He has a way of infusing characters and context into rich story lines, riddled
with deeper meaning.

There is also a mode of storytelling which is so crisp, so vibrant.

All in impeccable prose. Polite, well measured, evenly paced.

Unfortunately, this book is probably overshadowed by his more popular The
Remains of the Day, which is thematically extremely similar, and is
arguably a better book.
