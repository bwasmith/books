## Quotes
I didn't know what to say. How clumsy I felt! I didn't know how to reach him,
where to find him... It's so mysterious, the land of tears (21)

First you'll sit down a little ways away from me, over there, in the grass. I'll
watch you out of the corner of my eye, and you wont' say anything. Language is
the source of misunderstandings. But day by day, you'll be able to sit a little
closer... (60)

## Thoughts/Description

A lovely children's book. In the category of books that young people should read
to feel full of life in the big, wide world we live in.

Simple truths children know, and adults should remember.
