## Quotes

Hansu already knew what there was to know about the girl, but that was different from knowing her thoughts. It was his way to ask many questions when he wanted to know someone's mind. Most people told you their thoughts in words and later confirmed them in actions. There were more people who told the truth than those who lied. Very few people lied well (36)

Hansu could say with confidence that the Japanese were pathologically intractable when they wanted to be. In this, they were exactly like the Koreans except their stubbornness was quieter, harder to detect (220)

You're living for a dream of a home that no longer exists (221)

Maybe the Jews have a right to have their own state, but I see no need for Mirah and Daniel to have to leave England. I think this nobility argument or a greater nation for a persecuted people is a pretext to eject all the unwanted foreigners (279)

The commonplace idea that girls were neater than boys was not true in her case (300)

Noa stared at her. She would always believe that he was someone else, that he wasn't himself but a fanciful idea of a foreign person; she would always feel like she was someone special because she had condescended to be with someone everybody else hated. His presence would prove to the world that she was a good person, an educated person, a liberal person. Noa didn't care about being Korean when he was with her; in fact, he didn't care about being Korean of Japanese with anyone. He wanted to be, to be just himself, whatever that meant; he wanted to forget himself sometimes. But that wasn't possible. It would never be possible with her (308)

There was nothing else he could think of, and he wanted to spare her cruelty of what he had learned, because she would not believe that she was no different than her parents, that seeing him as only Korean-- good or bad-- was the same as seeing him only as a bad Korean. She could not see his humanity, and Noa realized that this was what he wanted most of all: to be seen as human (308)

In a way Solomon was Japanese, too, even if the Japanese didn't think so. Phoebe couldn't see this. There was more to being something than just blood (471)

## Description
To Lisette:
It was written by a female Korean Immigrant to American, written about a Korean family who emigrates to Japan shortly after the occupation of Korea by Japan.

A really, really good immigrant story, talking of hardships and successes, trying to make it against extremely adverse conditions. Also, it is very interesting to see this familiar narrative of oppression, racism, and struggle played out by actors who are non-Western.

Other than that, the characters are created to show the complexity of the issues, several different types of people and traits are tastefully represented.

To Dragon Slayers:
A really engaging novel centered around a narrative familiar to many Americans: an immigrant's journey in a new place and the following generations' struggle to reconcile how to fit into a culture that is not entirely their own. Also particularly interesting because the major actors are all non-Western, adding distance to a story that commonly known to many of us here (sometimes with distance comes clarity).
