## Quotes 
Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have fogotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion, are the two things that govern us (13)

But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degernate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were much to afrad, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to (17)

With that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot yet find expression, or when some though that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield (17)

To hear one's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth (26)

Nowadays most people die a sort of creeping common sense, and discovering when it is already too late, that th only things one never regrets are one's mistakes (30)

Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them (48)

The exaggerated folly of threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivit to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breated more freely, and for the first time in many months she really admired her son. She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down, and mufflers looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cab-man. The moment was lost in vulgar details (52)

Dorian is far to wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear Basil (53)

You don't mean a single word of all of that, Harry; you know you don't (53)

There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love (64)

For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It shold have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us (104)

Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to play a part (128)

For all sins.. are sins of disobedience (139)

His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that sought to maim and mar the ferfection of its calm. With subtle and finely-wrought temperments it is always so. Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude (148)

The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing (159)

You will soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired (160)
